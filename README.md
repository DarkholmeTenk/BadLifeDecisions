Graphene Condoms' solution for comp34120 Exercise 2.

## Building

```sh
$ ./gradlew build
```

## Running

The GUI must be running before any leaders can be run:

```sh
$ ./scripts/runGUI.sh
```

With the GUI running, you can run a leader. For Example:

```sh
$ ./scripts/runLeader.sh bld.SimpleLeader
```
